### Abstract

1. Reproducibility crisis in species distribution modelling (SDM).
Difficult for new SDM users to access latest methods.
Equally difficult for methods developers to disseminate their advances.

2. The `zoon` R package encodes SDM analyses as a simple workflow of five steps: obtaining occurrence data, obtaining covariate data, pre-processing these data, fitting a model, and generating outputs.
Each of these steps is carried out by one or more community-contributed software modules 
This framework facilitates rapid dissemination of novel SDM methodologies by lowering the bar to creating research software.
`zoon` workflows are re-runnable records of the data, code and results of an entire SDM analysis and can be easily reproduced, scrutinized and extended by the whole research community.
 
3. Extra stuff (cross validation, parallel methods comparisons)

4. We illustrate the `zoon` R package by recreating X SDM analyses from recent research articles in this journal: 

5. While the zoon R package can be used in isolation, future work will develop an online platform to facilitate exploring contributed modules and workflows.
This platform will also provide an online space to discuss, and openly evaluate, proposed best practices in SDM.
The zoon R package therefore represents the first step towards a more ??? ecosystem of SDM software.
